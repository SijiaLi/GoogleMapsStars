1. Get Geo Info
Use [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) to download information saved in Google Maps.

2. Get Clean Data of NYC
The downloaded file is in json format. The script nyc.r cleans the dataset and subset the locations in NYC, then saved the clean nyc data to a file called "data.csv"

3. Convert CSV to GEOJSON
The file csv_to_json.py converts the data to geojson as that's the data type GitHub renders.




Here's the interactive [visualization](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/geojson?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SijiaLi/GoogleMapsStars/master/nyc.geojson) ðŸ’Ž  enjoy!
