After 10+ trips to NYC I feel like it would be so much fun to create my own NYC vlog in a geeky way! As a result, I made a interactive map filled with all the fun places I've been to: coffee shops, restaurants, landmarks, hippie stores, even fitness studios.

I collected data from my Google Maps history, did some data cleaning and formatting, and converted the file to geojson format that GitHub requires for rendering. Voila, [here](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/geojson?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SijiaLi/GoogleMapsStars/master/nyc.geojson)  it is!

### How to make a similar visualization
1. Get Geo Info
Use [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) to download information saved in Google Maps.

2. Get a subset of NYC data
The downloaded file is in json format. The script nyc.r cleans the dataset and subset the locations in NYC, then saved the clean nyc data to a file called "data.csv"

3. Convert CSV to GEOJSON
The file csv_to_json.py converts the data to geojson as that's the data type GitHub renders.



Here's the interactive [visualization](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/geojson?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SijiaLi/GoogleMapsStars/master/nyc.geojson) ðŸ’Ž  enjoy!
